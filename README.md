# automatic-dust-collection
this project was created to build a cheap alternative to expensive automatic dust collection systems designed to monitor your machines and to keep them clean
this system is based on an arduino nano and a acs712 current sensor board which both can be bought online

the project was created in arduino version 1.8.2 but should be compatible with other arduino builds
